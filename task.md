# Task

Write a function `groupById`, that will take an array of objects and return a map, where keys are values of these objects `id` fields.

All `id`'s are assumed to be unique (no need to check for it) and can be either string of number.

Function must be type-safe

Alias the returned type - it should be obvious it is objects of certain type, grouped by their by `id`.
